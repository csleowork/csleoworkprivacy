<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November ,2024</p>
<p><strong>Update At:</strong> 19 February, 2025</p>
<h2>Statement of Changes to Ad Services and Data Collection</h2>
<p>Previously, the app used the Google AdMob service to display ads to users and collect relevant ad interaction data (e.g., ad impressions, click behavior). As of 19 February, 2025 of admob account closure, the App has terminated its partnership with Google AdMob and no longer collects any ad-related data through AdMob.</p>

<p>If you're using an older version of your app that still includes the AdMob SDK, keep in mind that:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Google may collect technical data (e.g. device model, operating system version) independently through its common services (e.g. Google Play Services), which is fully controlled by Google, in accordance with its <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">privacy policy</a> and is not associated with the developer of this app;</li>
    <li>Ad requests may fail to load due to service termination.</li>
</ol>

<h4>User Rights Exercise</h4>
<p>If you wish to access or delete ad interaction data previously collected through AdMob, please make a request directly to Google at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com">Google Privacy Tools</a> . The developer of this app no longer holds or controls such data.</p>

<h4>Our Improvements</h4>
<p>To increase transparency, we've proactively removed all ad service-related codes (e.g., the AdMob SDK) from new app versions(1.0.1) to ensure that there are no redundant data requests. We strongly recommend that you upgrade to the latest version.</p>

<h4>Notice of Future Changes</h4>
<p>If We re-enable ad serving, we'll notify you via an in-app announcement or changelog and update the Privacy Policy as well. You can review the latest policy at any time by visiting this page.</p>

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Statement of Changes to Ad Services and Data Collection</h2>
<p> Previously, the app used the Appodeal service to display ads to users and collect relevant ad interaction data. Starting from 27 November, 2025, the App has terminated its partnership with appodeal. Users of older app versions should be aware that Appodeal SDK may initialize,  but it may not able to display ads,  and it may not collect user data. However, Some third-party ads networks and services integrated through Appodeal may still collect limited technical information required for ad delivery and analytics. This depends on the individual networks’s SDK behavior, so certain networks may continue processing basic device or usage data as part of their normal operation. </p>
